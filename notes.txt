Grav cant write volumes mounted for development; but what if we allowed ALL
users to write a given directory?

Not great: When a folder is mounted, and the container is started with the ENV
    variable ENVIRONMENT=development (vs. anything else) we should chmod the
    folder so it is world writable/readable.

Better? NFS mount the development folder into the image...

Best: mount a volume into the container and have the container apply different
    ownership to the volume (internally) from the host. Or, more simply map one
    user on the container to the host.

Almost as good: Create a new user with the host user UID/GID and grant the
    relevant user (e.g. www-data) access to the group?
